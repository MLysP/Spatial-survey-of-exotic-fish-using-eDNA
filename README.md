Here is the R markdown detailing how I analysed the results in <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/15210/" target="_blank"><b>Picard et al., (2023) Optimal sample type and number vary in small shallow lakes when targeting non-native fish environmental DNA. PeerJ</b></a>

This code was written by Ma√Ølys Picard (mailys.picard@umu.se) and Anastasija Zaiko (now Sequench Ltd).
